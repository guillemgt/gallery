The Gallery of Babel is a virual gallery that contains a copy of every image that will ever exist, as long as that image has size 256x256 pixels.
It contains more than 10<sup>473479</sup> images, way more than atoms there are in the universe! It even has a picture of you and I together, whoever you are!
